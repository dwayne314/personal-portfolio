I built this portfolio to showcase my recent projects using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Installation and Setup

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

Installs the required packages in the root project directory

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production in the `.next` folder.\
It bundles the React application in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Application Features

### Important Packages

**[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/)**

A CSS utility framework to incorporate css in JSX.

## Consideration

I took some design inspiration from [Britney Chiang's gorgeous portfolio](https://brittanychiang.com/).
